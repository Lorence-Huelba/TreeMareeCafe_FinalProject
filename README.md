Tre Maree Café POS System

📍 About the Project

This project is a Web-Based Point-of-Sale (POS) System made specifically for Tre Maree Café, which has branches in Bauan and Batangas City. Before this system, their sales were done manually using pen, paper, and calculators — which often led to slow service, errors in computation, and hard-to-track sales records.

To improve their workflow, we developed this system to digitize the sales process, speed up transactions, and make it easier for staff to manage orders and receipts.

🔧 What the System Can Do

- Take and record customer orders through a simple web interface
- Let staff choose item sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)
- Automatically compute totals and generate digital receipts
- Calculate change and Shows the Final Receipt
- Work smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers

💻 Development Approach

We used the Agile method to develop the system. This allowed us to get feedback from the café during development and make improvements quickly. We also tested the system regularly to make sure it was working properly before full deployment.

🛠️ How It Was Built (Main Phases)

Initial Research – We observed the café’s daily operations and talked to the staff to understand their pain points.
Design – Created mock-ups for the POS layout to make it simple and mobile-friendly.
Development – Built core features like order input, receipt generation, and cart management.
Testing – Checked for bugs, errors in calculations, and made sure everything ran smoothly.
Launch – Deployed the system in both branches and trained the staff.
Post-launch Monitoring – Continued to gather feedback for updates and fixes.

🧪 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
We tested the system using real-world scenarios to ensure it met all the basic needs of the café. This included placing sample orders, printing receipts, and checking how it handled different edge cases.
